    "> Planning smooth trajectories is important for the safe, efficient and\n",
    "> comfortable operation of mobile robots, such as wheeled robots moving in\n",
    "> crowded environments or cars moving at high speed. Asymptotically optimal\n",
    "> sampling-based motion planners can be used to generate such trajectories\n",
    "> eventually. However, to achieve the necessary efficiency for the real-time\n",
    "> operation of robots, one often uses their initial feasible trajectories or the\n",
    "> trajectories of non-optimal planners instead, typically after a post-smoothing\n",
    "> step. We propose a gradient-informed post-smoothing algorithm, called GRIPS,\n",
    "> that deforms given trajectories by locally optimizing the placement of\n",
    "> vertices while satisfying the system's kinodynamic constraints.  We show\n",
